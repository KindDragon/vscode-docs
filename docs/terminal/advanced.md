# Terminal Advanced

## Persistent sessions

The terminal supports two different types of persistent sessions:

- Process reconnection: When reloading a window (eg. after installing an extension), _reconnect_ to the previous process and restore its content.
- Process revive: When restarting VS Code, a terminal's content is restored and the process is _relaunched_ using its original environment.

Both of these can be disabled by setting `terminal.integrated.enablePersistentSessions` to `false`, and the amount of scrollback restored is determined by `terminal.integrated.persistentSessionScrollback`. Process revive can be configured independently with `terminal.integrated.persistentSessionReviveProcess`.

### Moving terminals between windows

It's possible to drag terminal tabs across different windows to move them under that window. This can also be done manually through the command palette and the `Terminal: Detach Session` and `Terminal: Attach to Session` commands.

## Keybinding and the shell

TODO: Explain the conflicts that can occur when hosting a terminal inside another application
‚û°Ô∏è Why is VS Code shortcut X not working when the terminal has focus?

terminal.integrated.sendKeybindingsToShell
terminal.integrated.commandsToSkipShell

### Chords

Chord keybindings are those that are made up of two keybindings, for example Ctrl+K followed by Ctrl+C to change the line to a comment. TODO: ...
‚ö° üëê ‚öôÔ∏è Chord keybindings in the terminal
terminal.integrated.allowChords

Special case of chords:
‚û°Ô∏è Why is Cmd+k/Ctrl+k not clearing the terminal?
Merge into keybindings section

### Mnemonics

Using mnemonics to access VS Code's menu (eg. alt+f for File menu) is disabled by default as these key events are often important hotkeys in shells. Set `terminal.integrated.allowMnemonics` to enable mnemonics, note that this will disallow any alt key events to go to the shell. This setting does nothing on macOS.

### Custom sequence keybindings

‚ö° ‚öôÔ∏è Send text via a keybinding
workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence
‚û°Ô∏è ‚öôÔ∏è How do I configure zsh on macOS to jump words with Ctrl+Left/Right arrow?
