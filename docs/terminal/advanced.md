‚û°Ô∏è Why is Cmd+k/Ctrl+k not clearing the terminal?
Merge into keybindings section

### Mnemonics

Using mnemonics to access VS Code's menu (eg. alt+f for File menu) is disabled by default as these key events are often important hotkeys in shells. Set `terminal.integrated.allowMnemonics` to enable mnemonics, note that this will disallow any alt key events to go to the shell. This setting does nothing on macOS.

### Custom sequence keybindings

‚ö° ‚öôÔ∏è Send text via a keybinding
workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence
‚û°Ô∏è ‚öôÔ∏è How do I configure zsh on macOS to jump words with Ctrl+Left/Right arrow?
